A TO DO LIST WEBAPP



A to-do list web app is an application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks that they need to complete. Users can add new tasks, set priorities, deadlines, and categorize tasks based on different projects. They can mark tasks as completed,  or delete tasks, and receive reminders and notifications for upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks.

To-do list web apps are designed to help users organize their work, increase productivity, and manage their time effectively. They can be used for personal or professional purposes, and they can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, making them convenient for users on the go. Many to-do list web apps also offer collaboration features, allowing users to share their lists with others, assign tasks to team members, and track progress on shared projects
